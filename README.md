*this is a pretty simple project, just a main page with some shenanigans on it*

since i dont even have a gitIgnore here you can simply open the project, open the terminal and enter these commanes:
npm i - to install all the nessacry dependencies 
node index.js - to run the project

you can see the project in port 3000
